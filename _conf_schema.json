The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character. Your task is to translate the 2D facial features into a 3D sculpt, preserving the identity, expression, and core characteristics. If the source is blurry, interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined version that is clearly recognizable as the same character.\n\n**Scene Details:**\n1. **Figurine:** The figure version of the photo I gave you, with a clear representation of PVC material, placed on a round plastic base.\n2. **Packaging:** Behind the figure, there should be a partially transparent plastic and paper box, with the character from the photo printed on it.\n3. **Environment:** The entire scene should be in an indoor setting with good lighting."

The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Flawless Face & Likeness:** The figurine's face is the most critical element and must be a perfect, high-fidelity 3D translation of the character from the source image. The sculpt must be sharp, clean, and intricately detailed. **If the source image is blurry or lacks detail, you must interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined, and photorealistic version that is immediately and unmistakably recognizable as the same character.** Do NOT generate a generic or abstract face.\n\n**Scene Composition (Strictly follow these details):**\n1.  **Figurine & Base:** Place the highly detailed figurine at the center of the image on a computer desk. It must stand on a simple, circular, transparent acrylic base WITHOUT any text or markings. The figurine itself is the main focus of the image.\n2.  **Background Elements:** In the background, and slightly out of focus to emphasize the main subject, include a computer monitor displaying 3D modeling software (like ZBrush or Blender) with the digital sculpt of the very same figurine visible on the screen.\n3.  **Artwork Display:** Next to the computer screen, include a transparent acrylic board with a wooden base. This board holds a print of the original 2D artwork that the figurine is based on.\n4.  **Environment:** The overall setting is a desk, with elements like a keyboard to enhance realism. The lighting should be natural and well-lit, specifically designed to highlight the intricate details of the figurine's face and sculpt."
